# Real-Time-Distributed-Log-Processing-System
This is a distributed real-time log processing system that I built using Kafka, Redis, Docker, and Python. It’s designed to simulate high-velocity log data — like what you'd see in a production system — and process over 500,000 events per second with low latency and high availability.
