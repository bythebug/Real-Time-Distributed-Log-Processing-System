### 🧠 **What This Project Is**

“This is a distributed real-time log processing system that I built using Kafka, Redis, Docker, and Python. It’s designed to simulate high-velocity log data — like what you'd see in a production system — and process over 500,000 events per second with low latency and high availability.”

### 🎯 **What Problem It Solves**

“Modern systems generate tons of logs, and those logs are essential for monitoring, alerting, debugging, and analytics. But during peak traffic, log systems can become a bottleneck.

So I built a system that:
- Streams logs in real-time
- Processes and stores them efficiently
- Can scale horizontally
- Is fault-tolerant and fast”

### ⚙️ **How It Works (Architecture)**

You can explain it in 4 short parts:

1. **Producer (Python):**  
   - Simulates real-time logs (timestamp, log level, message)
   - Sends them to Kafka topic `logs`

2. **Kafka + Zookeeper:**  
   - Kafka handles high-throughput message streaming
   - Zookeeper keeps Kafka brokers coordinated

3. **Consumer (Python):**  
   - Listens to Kafka and reads logs
   - Caches them in Redis for fast access
   - Writes each log to a file (`logs.txt`) for persistence

4. **Redis:**  
   - Acts as a temporary, fast-access store (e.g., for dashboards, alerts)

### 🐳 **Why Docker?**

“I used Docker Compose to spin up Kafka, Redis, the producer, and the consumer in isolated containers — making the system portable and reproducible across any environment.”

---

### 📈 **Performance**

“In stress tests, it handled 500K+ logs/sec with a 40% latency reduction after tuning Kafka partitions and batch processing. It’s built to handle spikes and remain stable under load.”

### 💡 **What I Learned**

You can say:

- Real-time systems and stream processing
- Working with distributed tools like Kafka and Redis
- Dockerizing multi-service systems
- Debugging performance under pressure
- How to build scalable architecture using microservices

### ✨ “What’s Next?”

> “In the future, I want to extend this with Prometheus + Grafana for real-time metrics, and maybe use S3 or a database for long-term storage. I'd also love to add alerting for `ERROR` logs.”
